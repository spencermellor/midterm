<h1>Who's The Greatest Basketball Player of all Time?</h1>
	<p>This repository discusses who the greatest basketball player of all time is!</p>
	
<h1>Requirments</h1>
	<p>Use what we’ve covered so far (Terminal, Git and Github) to create a simple 1-page HTML
application. A few paragraphs of text for each point of view and at least one image for
each is required.
One team member must create a repository on Github with a Readme. Add your partner
as a collaborator. Put the appropriate information in the readme file (this will be basic,
because it’s a simple 1-off).
Each team member will create a branch and add their argument / position and image(s) to
the app. Merge everything to the master branch when you’re finished. Do code reviews
before you merge.
Push the finished files to your repo, double check to make sure you’ve merged everything
to the master branch and submit the repo URL to the FOL dropbox. </p>
